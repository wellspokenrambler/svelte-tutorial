<p class="styledParagraph p-1 border-2 border-red-500">
    I come from inside a nested component.
    <br/>
    I have the same classes as the styled paragraph in my parent component.
    <br/>
    The tailwind classes are applied because they're global.
    <br/>
    However, the purple colour and bold font weight are scoped to my parent component only, so I don't get those styles.
